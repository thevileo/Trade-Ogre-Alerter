# Trade-Ogre-Alerter
A C# Desktop and SMS alerter utility for the Trade Ogre Exchange

Twilio is needed for SMS Alerts (not bad, pay $20 and you good for a long time,but they offer you free trial too)
Its currently set so when the alerter goes off, it disables the SMS alert checkbox so you dont get overloard with texts.
