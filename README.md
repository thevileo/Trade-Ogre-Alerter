Changes:
V1.0 
- I seperated the execuatable files and the code files for ease of access(really for me). 
- Disabled resizing of the main form
- Auto Populated first crypto in drop down list to avoid exception errors. 
- SMS alert checkbox is disabled after 1st alert. This is to avoid being mass texted and wasting your trilio balance. Future updates may include something like "stop after x amount of alerts, but I dont really see the need at this time. 
- Added about tab, nothing fancy just alittle bit about how this simple project came into play.
